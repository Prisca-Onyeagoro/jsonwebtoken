what is JWT(jsonwebtoken)?

JWT is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information and also to protect users personal information and prevent unauthorize access to certain parts of the page. The users token are stored in a cookie(http Only) to prevent XSS(Cross-site Scripting) harm on the site.

so I implemented this beautiful piece of technology on a Register and Login Page(Secured Backend, Secured Frontend and Advanced Authentication and Authorization.), Only Registered Users can have access to a certain parts of the page.
